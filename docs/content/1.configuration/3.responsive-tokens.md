# Responsive tokens

Responsive tokens are a specific kind of tokens that takes the reponsive styling the other way around:

- Do not define how the responsive of a token should behave inside a component styling
- Define how the token should behave at which breakpoint from the theme configuration

Let's create a responsive token that use a light color in dark mode and a dark color in light mode:

```ts
export default defineTheme({
    primary: {
      initial: '{color.blue.900}',
      dark: '{color.blue.50}'
    },
    blue: {
      50: '#C5CDE8',
      100: '#B6C1E2',
      200: '#99A8D7',
      300: '#7B8FCB',
      400: '#5E77C0',
      500: '#4560B0',
      600: '#354A88',
      700: '#25345F',
      800: '#161E37',
      900: '#06080F',
    },
})
```

A **Responsive token** is recognized by defining a token value as an object that includes `initial` and another key from your media queries.

`initial` key refers to the default value, free of any media query.

This convention also works for [Variants](/styling/variants) and [Computed Styles](/styling/computed-styles).

Responsive tokens supports:
  - All your [media queries](/configuration/media-queries) in `media` key of your theme.config
  - `dark` and `light` native keys
  - [Tokens references](/configuration/theme-config#tokens-references)
  - Both `native` and `class` color scheme modes
