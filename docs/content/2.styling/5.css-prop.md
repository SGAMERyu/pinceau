# CSS Prop

The CSS prop allows you to write inline styles for your componnets that supports selectors and media queries.

It acts as a regular prop for your component, that gets defined using the `cssProp` helper.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { cssProp } from 'vue'

defineProps({
  css: cssProp
})
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <slot />
  </div>
</template>
```

## Context

The CSS props support all the syntaxes supported in the `css` function.

It will create a class that gets bound to the component if it is used in a parent context.

It should not have a default value, as that default value should be static CSS in your `css()` function.

## Local Tokens

The CSS prop will have the local tokens defined inside the component injected into it.

That means you can easily overwrite any local tokens from a parent component.

```vue
<template>
  <MyButton :css="{ '--button-primary': '{color.red.200}' }" />
</template>
```
